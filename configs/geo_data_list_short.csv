One Time Reset,mikewynne,qdbj-mk7w,Neighborhood Specific Impact Fee Areas,,"GIS (shapefile) data of neighborhood specific impact fee areas. The City imposes development impact fees on development projects in order to mitigate the impacts caused by new development on public services, infrastructure and facilities. For example, the burden on the transit system created by a new office building is offset through the payment of an impact fee used to improve MUNI.
Impact Fees are different from, and apply in addition to, application fees, which are used to cover the cost of the City’s review of a given proposal. For the most part, impact fees are assessed by the Planning Department and are collected by the Department of Building Inspection (DBI) upon permit issuance.
Some impact fees apply throughout the City to various types of development projects. Others apply only in certain neighborhoods. Another type of impact fee only applies when a builder chooses to pay them in-lieu of meeting a particular Planning Code requirement (e.g. usable open space).",Polygon,Parcel (block/lot),Planning,external dataset,https://data.sfgov.org/d/qdbj-mk7w,As needed,CPC-0031,,,,,64,64,2mw3-yx9h,success,seems to be a weird mix of both polygons and multipolygon shapes

One Time Reset,mikewynne,a3ua-edzd,Urban Bird Refuge,,"The adopted Standards for Bird-Safe Buildings explains the documented risks that structures present to birds. Over thirty years of research has proven the risk to be ���biologically significant�۝ for certain bird species. Recent studies have determined that annual bird fatalities in North America from window collisions may be as high as 1 billion birds per year or 1-5% of all birds. While the facts are staggering, the solutions are within reach. The majority of these deaths are foreseeable and avoidable. The document summarizes proven successful remedies such as window treatments, lighting design, and lighting operation.  The bird refuge maps out areas of particular risk to birds.  These areas are within 300ft of: open water, inland water bodies greater than 2 acres in size, open space greater than 2 acres, the shoreline.

One Time Reset,mikewynne,g4ye-s75w,Vehicle Miles Traveled Estimates from SF-CHAMP – 2012,,"This dataset was provided to the San Francisco Planning Department from the San Francisco County Transportation Authority (Transportation Authority) in March 2016. The Transportation Authority uses the San Francisco Chained Activity Model Process (SF-CHAMP) to estimate vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by private automobiles and taxis for different land use types. Travel behavior in SF-CHAMP is calibrated based on observed behavior from the California Household Travel Survey 2010-2012, Census data regarding automobile ownership rates and county-to-county worker flows, and observed vehicle counts and transit boardings. SF-CHAMP uses a synthetic population, which is a set of individual actors that represents the Bay Area’s actual population, who make simulated travel decisions for a complete day. 

VMT estimates are provided for existing (2012) and future (2040) for three land use types: office, residential, and retail. For these estimates, Transportation Authority used tour-based analysis for office and residential uses and a trip-based analysis for retail uses. The aforementioned VMT estimates are provided for each transportation analysis zone within San Francisco and compared to regional averages.
